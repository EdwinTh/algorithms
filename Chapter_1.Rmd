# Fibonnaci

Each number in the Fibonacci sequence is the sum of its two predecessors. 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34. It grows almost exponentially. A simple but very slow algorithm to calculate the n th position of the sequence would be an exponential implementation.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
fib_exp <- function(n) {
  if (n == 1) return(0)
  if (n == 2) return(1)
  return(fib_exp(n-1) + fib_exp(n-2))
}
exponential_time <- data_frame(n = 1:30, time = 0)
for (i in 1:30) {
  exponential_time[i, 2] <- system.time(fib_exp(i))[3]
}

ggplot(exponential_time, aes(n, time)) +
  geom_line() +
  ggtitle("Computation time of the recursive implementation")
```

An algorithm may yield the correct result, but if it is too slow it is useless. Therefore we measure the time it takes as a function of n. We always hope that we can do better.

With the current implementation the number of computer steps needed is larger than the actual value at n. Making this useless, the computation time increases exponentially.
